# oot3d-save-modifier
(Currently being worked on!) Ocarina of time 3d save modifer is a tool that allows you to manually add individual progressions. 

You can add certain items, weapons, medallions, and more! For example you could add that you have completed the deku tree to your save file, add that you have obtained a GS (gold skulltula), and even obtain things like dungeoun-specific maps, dungeoun-specific compasses, tunics, obtainbles (such as the gerudo token), and spiritual stones. You get the idea. 

Contribution:

Send me snapshots (copy of your save file) after you obtain an item or completed a dungeon, we can compare it to a blank savefile and add it to this modifier. AND PLEASE, PLEASE add a detailed explanation and explain as much as you can (completed deku tree, got slingshot, etc) Making multiple saves with different names is also helpful (might add name editor)

Send me your snapshots at my discord: erew0962
