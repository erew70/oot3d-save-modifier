# oot3d-save-modifier
(Currently being worked on!) Ocarina of time 3d save modifer is a tool that allows you to manually add certain items, weapons, medallions, and add individual progressions. For example you could add that you have completed the deku tree to your save file, add that you have obtained a GS (gold skulltula), and even obtain things like dungeon maps, certain compasses, tunics, obtainbles (such as the gerudo token), and spiritual stones.
